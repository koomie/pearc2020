## Need to document

#### Getting credits
* how to set up AWS / start with free credits
* links to other ways to get compute time
* perhaps find some NSF programs that help ala cloudbank

#### Setting up cloud IDE / initial instance to start work

#### Document ways to get AMIs for CentOS 8.1
* our AMIs that we build as part of this work how to pull those
* how to build your own AMI using packer starting from ours perhaps?
* how to build the golden first AMI for CentOS 8 with packer from scratch

#### What else needs to be here?
